.. To understand the function and diversity of proteins, we must first unveil their amino acid sequence. This can be accomplished via mass spectrometry or a nanopore sequencer. In a nanopore sequencer, protein molecules pass through nanopores, generating a series of shifting electrical signals that correspond to the protein amino acid sequence. These electrical signals need to be easily analyzed. Here, we developed **Npspy** (/n'pispai/, a New Protein Sequencing PYthon library) for processing protein electrical signals that aims to speed up the analyses.
