**Npspy** (/n'pispai/) is a Python library for ...

.. To understand protein function and biodiversity, the amino acid sequences of proteins must first be revealed. This can be accomplished via mass spectrometry or a nanopore sequencer. In a nanopore sequencer, protein molecules pass through nanopores, generating a series of shifting electrical signals that correspond to the protein amino acid sequence. These electrical signals need to be easily analyzed. **Here, we developed Npspy (/n'pispai/), a Python library for processing protein electrical signals that aims to speed up the analyses.**
