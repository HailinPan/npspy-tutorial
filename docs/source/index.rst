.. **Npspy** (/n'pispai/) is a Python library for processing protein electrical signals. In addition to mass spectrometry, protein sequences can also be sequenced through nanopore sequencer, in which a molecular of protein gets through the a nanopore, causing a series of changing electrical signals corresponding to the sequence of amino acids of the protein.

To understand protein function and biodiversity, the amino acid sequences of proteins must first be revealed. This can be accomplished via mass spectrometry or a nanopore sequencer. In a nanopore sequencer, protein molecules pass through nanopores, generating a series of shifting electrical signals that correspond to the protein amino acid sequence. These electrical signals need to be easily analyzed. Here, we developed **Npspy** (/n'pispai/), a Python library for processing protein electrical signals that aims to speed up the analyses.
